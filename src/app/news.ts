      'Eager to beat Verizon to the "early Black Friday" punch, T-Mobile unveiled a very interesting (and incredibly extensive) slate of holiday deals on pretty much all of its best phones, smartwatches, and tablets... with a whole bunch of strings attached last week.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Of course, it was fairly easy to guess for long-time bargain hunters that the "Un-carrier" still had a few tricks left up its sleeve, and now an additional Black Friday promotion has not only been unwrapped but also made available for anyone to enjoy before Christmas (and even Thanksgiving).',

      'Black Friday is almost upon us. By this time next week, many will have likely snatched a smartphone or another device at a bargain price. In a nutshell, the end of November is the perfect time for shopping, and many stores are doing your best to get your dollar.\n' +

      'Apple is no exception. Unsurprisingly, however, the company has its own peculiar way of handling a Black Friday shopping event. Apple (in typical Apple fashion) does things differently and will not be offering discounts outright. Instead buyers will be offered gift cards when they make a purchase.',
